<!-- Sprint Challenge Questions




1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

	With adaptive layout, we take the fixed layout code and apply media queries to it.

	Responsive uses constraints with % based layouts for that seamless feeling between devices. 
	For example, can use a css property of max-width to control the maximum width of a container while also providing % flexibility below it. 

	


2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

	Mobile first implies you will design and code for a mobile device first, and expand layout or features as you gain more screen space toward desktop.

	Desktop first is the oppossite of mobile first, where you design for desktop device first, and then adjust layout or features as you reduce screen space towards mobile screen display.


3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

	Assuming the browsers default front size is 16px, setting the font size in html to 62.5% sets fonts to the entire page to 10px. Which makes it easier to calculate rem units. For example: 1 rem = 10 px, and 1.5 rem = 15 px.
	Therefore, making it easier to apply override text in other parts of the web page by being able to calculate rem values for fonts on the fly.


4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

		
	CSS on its own is great. But stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Less lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, and others that make writing CSS quick and keep it DRY.
		


5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

	
	I like the idea of nesting in Less since it allows me to have more control over which areas I need to use specificity, and better understand parent and child relationships. Because of this, I am able to write code much quicker.I don't have much trouble at all using variabnles, mixins and nesting. 
	
	The only thing I find a little confusing is that mixins are written like classes are, but used differently.

      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
    
      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
      
        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
